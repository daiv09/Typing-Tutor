The cat sits on the mat  
I like to play every day  
He is a good boy today  
She reads books in the library  
I love coding on my computer  
The fox jumps over the dog  
She sells seashells by the shore  
Typing is fun for me now  
I enjoy a cup of coffee  
Cats and dogs play in the yard  
My friend came over for lunch  
We walk in the park often  
The sun shines bright in summer  
I read a book last night  
They swim in the cool pool  
She writes a letter to him  
The car drives down the road  
He takes the bus to work  
We eat dinner at the table  
Birds fly high in the sky  
The clock shows the right time  
I wash my hands with soap  
They play music very well  
The door is open for you  
She makes her bed every morning  
We watch movies on the weekend  
He runs five miles each day  
The stars shine in the night  
I plant flowers in my garden  
The fish swim in the tank  
My dog runs in the park  
We cook dinner in the kitchen  
She draws pictures of the mountains  
The rain falls on the roof  
I clean my room every week  
They sing songs at the concert  
The train arrives at the station  
He builds houses for a living  
We pick apples from the tree  
The wind blows through the trees  
I ride my bike to school  
She helps children learn to read  
The baby sleeps in the crib  
We shop for food on Monday  
He plays games with his friends  
The snow falls during the winter  
I write notes with a pen  
They climb the tall mountain quickly  
The moon glows in the sky  
She dances with grace and style  
We drink water when we exercise  
He draws comics in his notebook  
The grass grows after the rain  
I feed my pets every day  
They tell stories about their trip  
The boat floats on the lake  
She bakes cookies for the class  
We drive cars on the highway  
The bear sleeps during the winter  
I paint pictures of the ocean  
He wears a hat in summer  
The fire keeps the room warm  
They walk dogs in the park  
She opens windows on warm days  
We listen to music at night  
The ball rolls across the floor  
I drink juice with my breakfast  
He climbs trees in the forest  
The child plays with the toy  
We swim laps in the pool  
She makes coffee every morning  
The leaves fall in the autumn  
I visit friends on the weekend  
They take photos of the sunset  
The teacher helps all the students  
He fills the glass with water  
We fold clothes after washing them  
The bus stops at the corner  
I count to ten very fast  
She jumps rope in the yard  
The lion roars at the zoo  
We cross streets at the light  
He cuts paper with the scissors  
The bell rings at three  
I smile when I am happy  
They build castles in the sand  
The duck swims in the pond  
She reads stories to the children  
We plant trees in the spring  
The key opens the front door  
I wash dishes after we eat  
He draws maps for the city  
The light shines through the window  
They catch fish in the river  
She writes books for young readers  
We play cards on rainy days  
The frog jumps into the pond  
I learn new words every day  
He makes bread in the kitchen  
The game ends with a tie
